### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I

Computer Vision Research Engineer with 3+ years experience in deep learning: from research to implementation and design of R&D infrastructure. I built a big part of the computer vision stack at [Heuritech](https://www.heuritech.com/), a company specialized in the daily analysis of millions of images from social media to predict the future of fashion trends.
  
Im a currenlty looking for a new job as deep learning research engineer (Computer vision, NLP,...).

### My projects

##### Kerod (Keras Object Detection)

Pure tensorflow 2.X implementation of object detection algorithms (Faster R-CNN, Object Detection with Transformers, Deformable Detr...).
Aims to build a **clear**, reusable, **tested**, **simple** and **documented** codebase for production or pedagogical purposes.

#### Contributions

- Tensorflow multiple issues
- [Prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect) an awesome, Airflow like (but more pythonic) orchestration library.

### Miscellaneous

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an implementation of [Deformable DETR: Deformable Transformers for End-to-End Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04159)
