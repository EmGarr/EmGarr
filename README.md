### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I

Computer Vision Research Engineer with 3+ years experience in deep learning: from research to implementation and design of R&D infrastructure. I built a big part of the computer vision stack at [Heuritech](https://www.heuritech.com/), a company specialized in the daily analysis of millions of images from social media to predict the future of fashion trends.
  
I am currenlty looking for a new job as deep learning research engineer (Computer vision, NLP,...).

- Aims to build a **clear**, reusable, **tested**, **simple** and **documented** codebase for production or pedagogical purposes.

#### Contributions

- Tensorflow multiple issues
- [Prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect), Airflow like (but more pythonic), an awesome orchestration library.

### Miscellaneous

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an implementation of [Fast Convergence of DETR with Spatially Modulated Co-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07448v1)
